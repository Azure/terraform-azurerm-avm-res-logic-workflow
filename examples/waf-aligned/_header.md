# WAF-Aligned example

This deploys the module as aligned to WAF framework. This includes Diagnostics settings, Role assignments, tags etc. It also takes as a parameter the JSON representation of an existing Logic App workflow - this can be exported from an existing Logic App resource, authored via the Azure Portal or VS Code.
